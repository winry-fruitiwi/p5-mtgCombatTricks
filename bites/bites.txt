			when the above are pressed, print num times pressed for that color
			when the above are pressed, print cmv of current mana pool
			print card names in BRO that have cmv or less when z is pressed
			when C, W, U, B, R, or G are pressed, decrement num times pressed
			when above are pressed, decrement cmv of current mana pool

		mana value/mana color checks, assuming all basic/colorless lands

		basic interface
			display "c w u b r g" vertically, multiply strings by num times pressed
			show pictures of cwubrg (Zz can give them to me) instead
			display cwubrg pictures horizontally, add bar on top if color pressed

		showing the cards
			show card art for each card when queried
			add border to card art
			add text for card name inside border

		hovering mechanism: side project. worry about this later!

		showing the cards when hovered over
			display full card when hovering
			bonus to avoid annoying popups: display full card only as image pressed
