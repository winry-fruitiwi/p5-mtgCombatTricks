	back-end
		basic card retrieval protocols
			print out names of cards
			print CMC and mana cost of cards
			print card type if it's instant
			print oracle text if card type is instant
			search oracle text for titlecase flash, if found, print oracle text

		basic mana value and CMV selectors
			when c, w, u, b, r, or g are pressed, print out associated names
			when the above are pressed, print num times pressed for that color
			when the above are pressed, print cmv of current mana pool
			print card names in BRO that have cmv or less when z is pressed
			when C, W, U, B, R, or G are pressed, decrement num times pressed
			when above are pressed, decrement cmv of current mana pool

		mana value/mana color checks, assuming all basic/colorless lands
			keep track of what colors are selected
			if color identity is '' or contains selected colors, print card name
				check color identity == '' because of colorless cards

		mana value/mana color checks, including hybrid lands

		hybrid mana value checks

		phyrexian mana?

	front-end
		basic interface
			display "c w u b r g" vertically, multiply strings by num times pressed
			show pictures of cwubrg (Zz can give them to me) instead
			display cwubrg pictures horizontally, add bar on top if color pressed

		showing the cards
			show card art for each card when queried
			add border to card art
			add text for card name inside border

		hovering mechanism: side project. worry about this later!

		showing the cards when hovered over
			display full card when hovering
			bonus to avoid annoying popups: display full card only as image pressed


add transparent background image
    use commands clear(); background(234, 34, 24, 40)
    dim the background with a gradient (optional)
rename strip.show() to strip.originalShow(), create strip.mtgPrimerShow()
    when unselected, mtgPrimerShow should have:
        transparent black stroke
        transparent color fill
        transparent black mana symbol
    when selected, mtgPrimerShow should have:
        black stroke
        color fill
        black mana symbol
get Andrew Gioia manafont's colors for mana instead of ones I created on my drawing pad
    the easiest way to do this is to take a photo of mtgPrimer's and extract colors
there are a lot of different textures in mtgprimer. maybe look into using some?
    find photos of textures online: light gray fabric, dark gray fabric with specks of lighter gray
use svgs for cmc numbers or at least draw a gray non-transparent circle behind cmc number
    are there svgs?
when an image is clicked on, show it much larger until you click again or a key is pressed
