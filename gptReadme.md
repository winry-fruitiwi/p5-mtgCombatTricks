# p5-mtgCombatTricks

**Never forget a combat trick again.**  
This interactive web app helps Magic: The Gathering players browse all combat 
tricks available in any color combination—even if the opponent’s deck uses all 
five colors.

## ✨ Features
- Filter combat tricks by any color or combination.
- Select from different sets (stored in local browser storage).
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick color selection: `W`, `U`, `B`, `R`, `G`, `C`.
- Built using `p5.js`, rendered entirely on a canvas with minimal HTML elements.

## 🛠️ Notes
- The UI may not render correctly with extensions like DarkReader—please disable 
them when viewing.
- Set selection currently requires a **manual page reload** after choosing a 
new set.
- Colorless mana (`C`) is included for future functionality but doesn't affect
results yet.

## 🎥 Demo

## 🔍 Background
